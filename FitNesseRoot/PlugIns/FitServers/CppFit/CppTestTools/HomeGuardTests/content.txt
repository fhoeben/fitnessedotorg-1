Different COMMAND_PATTERNs are needed based on the development environment.  !-Assuming that the HomeGuard project is in c:/Projects/Cpp/HomeGuard these command patterns are used.-!  Only one should be enabled at a time.  Remove the ! from the one not needed.  Adjust the paths as needed.

For Visual C++ use this !define COMMAND_PATTERN.  Also make sure the path is set correctly in !-HomeGuardAtRunner.bat-!
!define COMMAND_PATTERN {C:/SourceNode/fitnesse/CppTestToolsProjects/Cpp/HomeGuard/test/HomeGuardAtRunner.bat}

For gcc use this !define COMMAND_PATTERN
!define COMMAND_PATTERN {C:/Projects/Cpp/HomeGuard/HomeGuardFitnesseServer/HomeGuardFitnesseServer.exe}
