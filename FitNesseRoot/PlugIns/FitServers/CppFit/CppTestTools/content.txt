!-CppTestTools provides a unit test harness and an implementation of FIT for c++.  It also has a starter implementation for a concurrency library.  This library is used by the FitServer.  Implementations are provided for gcc and visual c++ v6.-!

Actually !-CppTestTools-! is rather obsolete.  It has been broken into two pieces: [[CppUTest][www.cpputest.org]] and !-CppFit-!.  You can find the [[!-CppFit-! zip file here][http://fitnesse.org/files/CppTestTools/CppFit-2009-02-05-11-47.zip]].  The zip file is bundled with !-CppUTest-!.

There are some instructions and examples in the zip file.  Much of what is here is probably close to right.  There is one intermittent unit test failure, associated with closing a socket I think.  if you find it let me know.
