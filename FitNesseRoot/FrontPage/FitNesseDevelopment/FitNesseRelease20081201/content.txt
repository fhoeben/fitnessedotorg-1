!3 FitNesse Release Notes 12/01/2008
!note Uncle Bob, Object Mentor, Inc.

This is just a bug-fix release.  If you hare having trouble with any of the SLIM stuff, you should download this release.  The jar file should be sufficient, although some of the docs changed a bit.

 * Added &debug flag to TestResponder url.  This forces the test to run ''inside'' the fitnesse process.  If you are running fitnesse in a debugger, you can breakpoint your fixtures.
 * Symbols can be java properties or environment variables.  Symbols first, env variables second, java properties third.
 * If the first cell of a script table is a symbol assignment ($V=) then the rest must be a function call.  The symbol is assigned the return value of the function.
 * Fixed some bugs in Decision Table that misreported exceptions when the execute method was not present.
 * Fixed bug in QueryTable that misreported when the query method returned null.
 * Made unit tests more reliable. (Jaques Morel)
