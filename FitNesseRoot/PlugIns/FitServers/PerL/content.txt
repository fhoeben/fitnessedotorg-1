The perl FitServer requires an installation of perl, FitNesse, and the 
Test-C2FIT-0.01a perl module (http://search.cpan.org/~tjbyrne/Test-C2FIT-0.01a/)

I installed the the files !-FitServer.pl-! and !-FitServer.pm-! in a perl directory located at the 
same level as the dotnet directory on the fitserver . you should just be able to untar
 the file !-perl-FitServer.tar.gz-! at that location. The tarfile contains the following

!-perl/-!
!-perl/FitServer.pl-!
!-perl/FitServer.pm-!
!-perl/README.txt-!
!-perl/Test/-!
!-perl/Test/C2FIT/-!
!-perl/Test/C2FIT/eg/-!
!-perl/Test/C2FIT/eg/ArithmeticColumnFixture.pm-!
!-perl/Test/C2FIT/eg/ArithmeticFixture.pm-!

This has only been tested on win xp and server 2003, Mac OS X 10.4 and linux, it has not been tried on any other 
unix variant, but i would expect that it would work simply by editing the first line of !-FitServer.pl-! and 
pointing to the path of your perl installation. On non MS platforms you may also be able to alter the 
TEST_RUNNER variable specified below to only contain !-perl/FitServer.pl-! (Notice the 'forward slash'!)
if you set exec bit on (for example !-'chmod +x perl/FitServer.pl'-!).


The !-Test::C2FIT::eg::ArithmeticColumnFixture-! is now part of the tar file, these were actually part 
of the Test::C2FIT distro

I added the following to my wiki page.



!define COMMAND_PATTERN {%m}
!define TEST_RUNNER {perl perl\FitServer.pl}


!|eg.ArithmeticColumnFixture|
|x |y |plus() |times() |divide() |floating()|
|2 |3 |5 |6 |0|0.6666667|
|0 |0 |0 |0 |error |error|
|0 |0 |0 |0 |||
|200 |300 |500 |60000 |0|0.6666667|
|2 |3 |5 |6 |0|0.6666667|
|200 |3 |203 |600 |66|66.6666666666667|
|2 |-3 |-1 |-6 |0|-0.6666667|

and set it's properties to test and it worked fine.
